## About Awesome Research
Awesome Research is an addon I made to determine if gear obtained by my alts can be researched on my main crafter.  If you have a single character crafting everything, then this may be useful to you.  

## Configuration
Install the addon and change the AIR.main variable to your crafters character name.  

## How to use
Researched trait data will be saved anytime you log into your main character.  Anytime you play an alt, a green research icon will display next to any item that can be researched by your main.
